### Hey everyone 👋

I'm Umut, and I'm all about diving into open source, making tunes, curating playlists, and creating visual art. My plate is perpetually loaded with projects because I find joy in exploring, experimenting, and unraveling all the things.
Finding time for everything is hard, but what keeps me going is the joy of creating things that matter.
Let's keep this creative vibe alive and make our world a cooler place together.

- 🚀 I’m currently working on a focus app for distracted people. Stay tuned :)
- 💡 I’m currently learning SwiftUI.
- 👨‍💻 I’m looking to contribute more to neovim and it's ecosystem.
- 🎨 I love developing themes and customizing my setup to look pleasant and be productive.
- 🎥 I'm planning to stream my open source journey and build my ideas in public.
